/work_dir:"path to directory"               Agent must use "path to directory" as working dir (this directory may included configuration file) 
                                            Default is "%ALLUSERSPROFILE\Application Data\OCS Inventory NG\Agent"
						
/local=["path to folder"]                   Agent do not contact communication server, and store inventory in xml compressed .ocs file into folder "path to folder"
                                            If no "path to folder" provided, agent assume folder as data folder

/debug[=level]                              Generate a very verbose log file "ocsinventory.log" into agent's install folder
                                            0 => disable verbose logs (default)
                                            1 => enable default verbose logs (default when no level provided provided)
                                            2 => enable debuging logs

/notag		                                  Agent must NOT prompt user for TAG in any case
	
/tag="my value"                             Agent must set "my value" as TAG value
	
/xml=["path to folder"]                     Agent must store inventory in uncompressed xml format into folder "path to folder" 
                                            If no "path to folder" provided, agent assume folder as data folder
	
/force		                                  Always send inventory, even if server do not ask for it (use only for debugging purpose !)
	
/ipdisc="network number"	                  Agent must launch IP discovery on network "network number" (use only for debugging purpose !)

/ipdisc_lat="number of milliseconds"        Set latency between 2 IP Discover requests to "number of milliseconds"
    
/fastip		                                  Never wait for latency  between 2 IP Discover requests (use only for debugging purpose !)
	
/hkcu                                       Search also for software under HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive (do not work with service as LocalSystem !)

/uid                                        Agent must generate a new unique device ID
	


Default Communication Provider HTTP.dll Command Line Options:

                                            Agent try to connect to Communication Server address and port Listening on http[s]://server.domain.tld[:port]/ocsinventory
	
/ssl=0|1                                    When usng SSL connections, 0 => SSL without certificate validation, 1 => SSL with server certificate validation required (needs CA certificate)   

/ca="path_to_cabundle.pem"                  Path to CA certificate chain file in PEM format, for server certificate validation

Configuration file:
-------------------

Some command line options can be store into configuration file. Default is assumed to be ocsinventory.ini into agent's data folder, usually "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\OCS Inventory NG\Agent".
Agent can create this cnfiguration using /save_conf command line switch, to allow encrypting into config file username and password. 

Here is a sample configuration file to talk with a server on local computer.
